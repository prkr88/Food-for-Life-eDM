							Hi All, 
							<br/><br/>
							Please see the following eDM design for FFL-SG. The template is filled with placeholder content to show what the final design could look like. 
							The real content images will need to be treated with play icons and timestamps. Once the design is approved, all the copy, 
							tracking links and images should be supplied so that the template can be populated ASAP. I can provide a datasheet with the required fields if needed.
							<br/><br/>
							Please let me know your thoughts, and any feedback is always appreciated. 
							<br/><br/>
							Cheers,
							<br/><br/>
							Michael
